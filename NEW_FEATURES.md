4. Generate presentation
5. Diagrams are added automatically!

### Command Line
```bash
# With AI images
python free_slide_generator.py "Your topic" --ai-images

python free_slide_generator.py "Your topic" --images

# Both diagrams and AI images
python free_slide_generator.py "Your topic" --ai-images --slides 10
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Best Diagram Results
- Use keywords: "process", "timeline", "comparison", "cycle", "hierarchy"
- Be specific about what to compare or the steps involved
- Mention chronological elements for timelines

### For Best AI Images
- Request detailed descriptions in your prompt
- Mention specific visual styles (3D render, professional, minimalist)
- Include color preferences that match your theme

### Example Prompts

**Good:** "Create a presentation about machine learning workflow, including the iterative process of data collection, training, evaluation, and deployment"
**Result:** Cycle diagram showing ML workflow

**Good:** "Compare traditional vs agile project management methodologies with pros and cons of each approach"
**Result:** Comparison diagram with two columns

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

1. **AI Image Timeout** - Sometimes takes 30+ seconds, falls back to stock
2. **Diagram Overlap** - Very long text may need manual adjustment
3. **Theme Colors** - Some themes work better with specific diagram types

## üìù Future Enhancements
